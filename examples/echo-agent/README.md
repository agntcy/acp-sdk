# Echo Agent

The echo agent simply repeats input to output adding a new
"assistant" message with a limited number of supported
transformations of the last "human" type message:

- to-upper: convert text to upper case
- to-lower: convert text to lower case

The agent is intended to be used for simple test cases where
access to an LLM is either unsupported or undesired. The agent
outputs a deterministic value based on the input to better
support testable outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

##Â Running the Echo Agent directly

- Install dependencies

  ```
  poetry install
  ```

- Run the agent CLI using poetry
  ```
  export TO_LOWER=true ; poetry run echo_agent --human "What is actually up?"
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "type": "human",
        "content": "What is actually up?"
      },
      {
        "type": "assistant",
        "content": "what is actually up?"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Running the Echo Agent using Agent Workflow Server

- Create an environment variable file if desired based on the example

- Make sure that the [workflow server manager](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/agws/workflow_server_manager.html#getting-started) cli (wfsm) is added to your path

- Start the workflow server. Note the existing manifest
  assumes you are deploying from the directory with the `pyproject.toml`
  file for the echo agent. Adjust as needed.

Using wfsm run:

```
wfsm deploy --manifestPath deploy/echo-agent-manifest.json --configPath=deploy/echo-agent-wfsm-config.yaml
```

When the serve is up an running we can make a request to the agent using `curl`:

```
curl -s -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-api-key: 9460bf1c-cd3f-47dd-afd5-6874c6406d22" -d '{"agent_id": "'55ba4a13-6559-4752-a080-72f5de39cb63'", "input": { "messages": [ { "type": "human", "content": "What is up, Dude?" } ] }, "config": { "configurable": { "to_upper": true } } }' http://127.0.0.1:62393/runs/wait
```
